I'm using a dataset downloaded from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), the data is in the public domain and can be used freely.
In case using the same dataset or generating a new one from NCEI you need to cite the origin.
If interested in generating a similar dataset from another station you can start from the Search Tool, select Daily Summaries, the time range of interest, search for Cities and in the Search Term put the city you're looking for.
When selected you need to add to Cart like an order but there is no charge for ordering data from Climate Data Online as explained in their FAQs.

The Notebook was generated using Python 3.8.0 and libraries in requirements.txt.
